## Basics

1. Setting up a Header, Body and Footer with `header`, `section`, `main` and `footer`

2. Setup Grid of Grids
    - `.grid` containing 9 `.grid.grid-bigSquare`
    - with each `.grid.grid-bigSquare` containing 9 `.grid-smallSquare`

3. Create a [External SVG Icon File Set](./icons.svg) of `defs` / `symbols` - These are called **Sprites**
    - Extract specific icons with `<use>` tag linked with `id` of the `defs`
    - Add all icons to the same file
